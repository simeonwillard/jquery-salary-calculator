## Description

This project takes user input for an employee and displays the input on the DOM in a table when you click the Submit button.  The table records the employee name, their employee ID number, their job title and their annual salary.  The project then calculates the monthly wage of each employee and adds each wage to calculate the total monthly cost of all employees on the table.  There is also a delete button that will delete the selected employee from the DOM.
